# Fit Tracker
Maintaining a consistent workout routine is challenging for individuals juggling busy schedules, diverse fitness goals, and limited access to resources. To those unfamiliar with working out, even just planning a routine will add some difficulty when starting out. These challenges often lead to inefficient workouts, lack of motivation, and suboptimal results. There is a need for a solution that simplifies workout planning, adapts to individual needs, and optimizes time spent exercising.

Introducing the Fit Tracker, a comprehensive fitness tool designed to make working out more convenient and effective. Utilizing a database of workouts categorized by muscle groups, accessibility, and efficiency, this tool will eliminate these challenges and allow users to quickly and easily plan their workouts and work towards their goals more efficiently by searching the database for the exercises relevant to them.

Along with this accessible database of possible exercises, users will also be able to input their fitness goals such as weight loss or growth, equipment availability, and free time during the week. This will allow the Fit Tracker to narrow down the pool of exercises recommended to users to fit their needs, and efficiently schedule and direct their workouts for the results they desire.
